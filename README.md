# JavaScript-ful-XPATH-from-target-element
This JavaScript function generates full XPATH for given evnet.target element

**If element has a parent with id:**
//div[@id="menu-item-512"]/a

**If element does not have parent with id:**
//body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/article[1]/header/h2/a


It was a perfect solution for me when generating XPATH for an element for using it with Selenium.
